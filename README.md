# Code Challenge: Fullstack Web Developer

## Code Challenge

### Task

You are required to create a simple web application that allows users to submit a monetary transaction. The application should consist of a front-end built with React and a back-end using Node.js and Express. The application should allow users to input the transaction amount and a description, and upon submission, it should display the transaction details on the front-end.

### Requirements

1.  **Front-End (React)**

    - Create a form that accepts:

      - Transaction Amount (number)
      - Transaction Description (text)

    - On form submission, display the transaction details below the form.

    - Ensure the application is responsive and user-friendly.

2.  **Back-End (Node.js + Express)**

    - Set up a simple Express server that handles POST requests to save transaction data.
    - Implement a GET endpoint to retrieve the transaction data.
    - Use an in-memory array to store transactions (no database required for this challenge).

3.  **Debugging and Testing**

    - Ensure that the application handles errors gracefully (e.g., invalid input).
    - Write a simple test case to verify that the transaction data is being saved correctly.

### Constraints

- The challenge should be completed in less than 30 minutes.
- Use only free resources and libraries.
